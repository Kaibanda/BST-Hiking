# BST-Mountain-Traversal


## Problem 1 (10 points)

This project is an implementation of a binary search tree. The elements are ordered using
their natural ordering.
  
This implementation provides guaranteed O(H) (H is the height of this tree
which could be as low as logN for balanced trees, but could be as large as N
for unbalanced trees) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and
contains).
 
This class implements many of the methods provided by the Java framework's
TreeSet class.
